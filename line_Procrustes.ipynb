        "In line-based Procrustes Analysis, we are interested in register a set of points to a set of lines, where the correspondence between point-line is explicitly known. Within the context of computer-assisted interventions (CAI), we are typically interested in **scaling**, followed by **rotation** and **translation** of a set of 3D *points* so they are registered (aligned) to a set of 3D *lines*. Again, Orthogonal implies that there is no searing. We also assume there is a 1:1 correspondence between these two 3D datasets.\n",
