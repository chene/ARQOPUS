        "The closed-form solutions for the [point-based Procruste Analysis](https://github.com/chene/ARQOPUS/blob/main/point_Procrustes.ipynb), and subsequently the solutions for the [line-based Procruste Analysis](https://github.com/chene/ARQOPUS/blob/main/line_Procrustes.ipynb) are least-squares solutions. They are *optimal* **only when** the underlying Fiducial Localization Error (FLE) is *zero-mean*, *isotropic*, and *identicaly distributed* (aka **i.i.d**). Such an idealized environment are often violated in the CAI setting. As a trivial example, [optical tracking systems based on stereo-cameras are known to exhibit anisotropic FLE](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-15711-0_73), althought it is more likely to be heteroscedastic as well.\n",
